						<h1>Ratings</h1>
						<p>EDeC ratings range from 0 to 10 &mdash; the higher the score, the better the product. Our scores are based on evaluations of a comprehensive set of health, environmental and social issues. If you are looking to switch to a better product, EDeC&#39;s summary rating can be used to easily identify the best products in a category. If you are looking for more detail, you can drill down from our summary rating to learn more about a product or companyâ€™s performance.</p>
				        
						<p><strong>EDeC&#39;s summary rating combines product- and company-level information to characterize a product&#39;s health, environmental and social impacts. The best products rate 8 or above; the worst rate 4 or below.</strong>  We provide a summary score because consumers want simple, actionable information that makes it easy to select better products.  See the Scoring section below to learn how to interpret EDeC&#39;s numerical 0-10 scale.</p>

                        <p><strong>EDeC&#39;s summary rating is compiled from three sub-scores addressing Health, Environment and Society.</strong>   In each of these broad areas of concern, EDeC identifies the critical issues that need to be evaluated and collects data on a set of indicators that are the best-available measures for assessing performance on that issue.  See the Health, Environmental and Society sections below to learn more about the issues that EDeC covers.</p>

                        <p><strong>EDeC makes it easy to unpack any summary rating and see how a product or company performs on every issue and indicator we track.</strong>  To view the complete set of indicators used to derive any rating, select the drop-down arrow on any Health, Environment or Society score on the EDeC website or follow the &ldquo;Behind the Ratings&rdquo; link in our mobile applications.</p>

                        <h2>What&#39;s Covered in our Ratings: Health</h2>

                        <p><strong>Our Health score characterizes the potential health impacts associated with use of a product.</strong>  GoodGuide uses a common assessment framework, pictured here, to organize the various indicators that are available to score products on Health.  There are four broad classes of indicators:</p>
                        <ol><li><strong>Human health impact</strong> indicators provide information about the potential health effects of a product category: What degree of health concern do product ingredients pose? What is the overall nutritional value of a food product?</li><li><strong>Data adequacy</strong> indicators track whether the information needed to assess health risks is available for a product.</li><li><strong>Other negative aspect</strong> indicators provide information about how a product is produced and regulated: Are any of its ingredients banned or restricted? Does its production involve the use of &ldquo;bad-actor&rdquo; chemicals targeted for phase-out? Does it contain contaminants from its production process?</li><li><strong>Product management</strong> indicators identify whether a company or its products are managed sustainably, based on third-party certifications that verify health or environmental performance.</li></ol>
                        <p>The availability and type of health scores vary across different product categories:</p>
                        <ul><li>For personal care and household chemical products, health scores are driven by the number of ingredients in a product that are of health or regulatory concern.</li><li>For food and beverage products, health scores are driven by our assessment of the nutritional value of the product, based on its ratio of recommended to restricted nutrients.</li><li>For other product categories like paper, lighting or appliances, no health scores are assigned because typical product use is not associated with any human health issues.</li></ul>
                        <h2>What&#39;s Covered in our Ratings: Environment</h2>

                        <p><strong>Our Environment score characterizes the potential environmental impacts associated with the manufacture, sale, use and disposal of a product.</strong>  GoodGuide uses a common assessment framework to organize the various indicators that are available to score products or companies on environmental performance.  There are four broad classes of indicators:</p>
                        <ol><li><strong>Environmental management</strong> indicators characterize overall corporate governance, the policies and practices a company has adopted (including their applicability to its supply chain), a company&#39;s compliance record and involvement in controversies, and whether a company is engaged in any exemplary practices.</li><li><strong>Transparency</strong> indicators track whether the information needed to assess environmental issues is made available by a company.  Resource use indicators track natural resource inputs used by a company to manufacture products, including materials, water, and energy.</li><li><strong>Environmental impact</strong> indicators track the outputs of a company&#39;s manufacturing processes, including whether a company&#39;s emissions or production practices are contributing to global warming, creating air or water pollution, generating waste, or adversely affecting ecosystems or biodiversity.</li></ol>
                        <p>Whenever possible, EDeC evaluates both the environmental characteristics of a specific product and the environmental policies and performance of the product&#39;s manufacturer.  However, because the availability of product-level environmental data is limited and varies by product category, EDeC&#39;s Environment scores are primarily based on company-level data.  The relative contribution of product- vs company-level data to Environment scores varies by product category:</p>
                        <ul><li>Environment scores are solely based on company-level data for personal care products, household chemicals, food, pet food, and apparel.</li><li>Product-level data contributes 25% of Environment scores for tampons, diapers and drinks.</li><li>Product-level data contributes 50% of Environment scores for cell phones.</li><li>Product-level data contributes 75% of Environment scores for bulk coffees and teas, chocolate, paper, lighting products, and appliances.</li></ul>
                        <h2>What&#39;s Covered in our Ratings: Society</h2>

                        <p><strong>Our Social score characterizes the social impacts associated with the manufacture and sale of a product.</strong> GoodGuide uses a common assessment framework to organize the various indicators that are available to score products or companies on social performance.  There are five broad classes of indicators:</p>
                        <ol><li><strong>Management</strong> indicators characterize overall corporate governance, the policies and practices a company has adopted (including their applicability to its supply chain), a  company&#39;s compliance record and involvement in controversies, and whether a company is engaged in any exemplary practices.</li><li><strong>Transparency</strong> indicators track whether the information needed to assess social issues is made available by a company.</li><li><strong>Consumer</strong> indicators include customer health and safety policies and controversies and product recalls, as well as information about labeling and marketing practices.</li><li><strong>Community</strong> indicators track a company&#39;s community relationships, stakeholder engagement initiatives, and public policy positions.</li><li><strong>Worker</strong> indicators track company performance on occupational safety and health, diversity and equal opportunity, and human and labor rights.</li></ol>
                        <p>Because the availability of product-level social data is limited and varies by product category, EDeC&#39;s Social scores are primarily based on company-level data.  The relative contribution of product- vs company-level data to Social scores varies by product category:</p>
                        <ul><li>Social scores are based solely on company-level data for personal care, household chemicals, food, pet food, paper products, apparel, cell phones, lighting products, and appliances.</li><li>Product-level data contributes 50% of Social scores for bulk coffees and teas and chocolate.</li></ul></div>
